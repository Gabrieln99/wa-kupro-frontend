# Image Upload System

The new image upload system provides two convenient ways to add images to products:

## üñºÔ∏è Features

### 1. File Upload (with ImgBB API)

- Drag & drop support
- File type validation (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
- File size limit (10MB)
- Progress indicator
- Automatic upload to ImgBB

### 2. Direct URL Input

- Paste any image URL
- Live preview
- URL validation
- Suggestions for free hosting services

## üîß Setup Instructions

### To Enable File Upload:

1. **Get a free ImgBB API key:**
   - Visit https://api.imgbb.com/
   - Create a free account
   - Go to your dashboard
   - Copy your API key

2. **Configure the API key:**
   - Open `src/config/imageConfig.js`
   - Replace `'YOUR_IMGBB_API_KEY'` with your actual API key

### Without API Key:

- Users can still use the URL input method
- The system will suggest free image hosting services
- Perfect for development or if you don't want to use APIs

## üöÄ Usage

### For Users:

1. **File Upload Tab:**
   - Click "Uƒçitaj sliku" tab
   - Drag & drop an image or click to browse
   - Click "Uƒçitaj sliku" button
   - Image automatically uploads and URL is set

2. **URL Input Tab:**
   - Click "URL slike" tab
   - Paste an image URL from any hosting service
   - See live preview of the image

### For Developers:

```vue
<template>
  <ImageUpload v-model="imageUrl" label="Product Image" />
</template>

<script setup>
import ImageUpload from './components/ImageUpload.vue'
import { ref } from 'vue'

const imageUrl = ref('')
</script>
```

## üîí Security Notes
